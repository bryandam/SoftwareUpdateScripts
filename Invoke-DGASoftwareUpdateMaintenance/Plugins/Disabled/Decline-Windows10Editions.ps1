.SYNOPSIS
Decline updates for editions of Windows 10 your organization does not support.
.DESCRIPTION
Decline updates for editions of Windows 10 your organization does not support.
.NOTES
You must un-comment the $SupportedEditions variable and add the editions your organization supports.
The KnownEditions variable holds a list of known editions to _try_ and prevent the script from going rogue if MS decides to change the naming scheme.  If ... or when ... they do this will need to be updated.

Version 1.0: 10/28/17
Version 2.4: 07/20/18
    Added the business and consumer versions to the known edition strings.  Note that this is a licensing distinction, not an OS edition where volume license equals business and everything else, including OEM, is considered consumer.

#Un-comment and add elements to this array for editions you support.  Be sure to add a comma at the end in order to avoid confusion between editions.
#Note: You must escape any parenthesis with the forward slash.  Ex.: "Feature update to Windows 10 \(business editions\)"
#$SupportedEditions = @("Feature update to Windows 10 Enterprise,","Feature update to Windows 10 \(business editions\),")

#If Microsoft decides to change their naming scheme you will need to udpate this variable to support the new scheme.  Note that commas are used to prevent mismatches.
